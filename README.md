# Murder in the Mansion an Arduino Game

## Manual

Murder is in the Mansion is a easy to play, easy to solve, game.

Based on the book/game by the same by Jim Cole.

This is a conversion of the Pocket-Basic game Murder in the Mansion
Conversion by LeRoy F. Miller original game published in "Murder in
the Mansion and Other Computer Adventures in Pocket-Basic for the 
TRS-80" by Jim Cole. The game is pretty simple, you have 4 suspects
to choice from, 4 weapons, and 4 rooms each is picked at "random" 
and you guess Weapon, Room (Where), and Who. If you guess wrong you 
are given a clue, the clue will let you pick right the next time around. 
So a very simple game to solve. The game is played in the Serial Console, 
and later will be converted for the Hero Jr project to play it.
